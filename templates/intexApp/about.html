    <p>More than 1 in 7 (~15%) of US adults, approximately 37 million people, are estimated to have  
        Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).  Worse yet, as many as 9 in 10 adults are actually unaware that 
        they have CDK.  In fact, 33% of the population is high risk for kidney disease. According to the CDC:</p> 
        <p>"When people develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), their kidneys become damaged and over time may 
            not clean the blood as well as healthy kidneys. If kidneys do not work well, toxic waste and extra 
            fluid accumulate in the body and may lead to:</p>

    <p>However, people with CKD and people at risk for CKD can take steps 
        to protect their kidneys with the help of their health care providers."</p> 
        <p>Several measures are being taken to combat kidney disease.  However, due to the scope 
            of the problem across the U.S., it can take up to 6 months to see a renal specialist 
            and get the needed help.  CKD can be reversed with a change of attitudes and behaviors 
            in regard to what we take into our bodies.</p>

    <p><strong>What are the main causes of chronic kidney disease?</strong></p> 
        <p>
            Diabetes and high blood pressure, or hypertension, are responsible for two-thirds of chronic kidney disease cases.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Diabetes: </strong>Diabetes occurs when your blood sugar remains too high. Over time, unmanaged blood sugar can 
                    cause damage to many organs in your body, 
                    including the kidneys and heart and blood vessels, nerves, and eyes. </li>
                <li><strong>High blood pressure: </strong>High blood pressure occurs when your blood pressure against the walls of your blood 
                    vessels increases. If uncontrolled or poorly controlled, high blood pressure can be a leading cause of heart attacks, 
                    strokes, and chronic kidney disease. Also, chronic kidney disease can cause high blood pressure.</li>
            </ul>
